## Welcome to your CDK TypeScript Construct Library project!

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK Construct Library that includes a construct (`RecaptchaAuthorizer`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The construct defines an interface (`RecaptchaAuthorizerProps`) to configure the visibility timeout of the queue.

### Useful commands

 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
